# Canvas Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome extension that upgrades the user experience when using Canvas. The extension will allow users to change the theme to dark mode, change the course name, and supply a list of all assignments due on a side panel. The product will only run when Canvas is running on Chrome. The extension should only change what the user sees on the front end.


# How to install

-First, download the latest source code under one directory.
-In the chrome browser, find your "Manage Extensions menu" while clicking the puzzle piece in the top right hand corner of your Chrome web browser, or Google search this address: <br>
**chrome://extensions**

-Next, **enable developer mode** by clicking the toggle switch next to 'Developer Mode' at the top right corner of the browser page.
-Finally, click the **'Load unpacked'** button near the top left corner of the browser page and select the extension's directory/folder.

# How to run

The application only runs when you have Canvas open. The application replaces the HTML with a more improved one, and only runs for that website.
