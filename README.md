# Canvas Chrome Extension

## What It Can Do

This is a Chrome extension that upgrades the user experience when using Canvas. This extension can do multiple things, such as an automatic dark mode that only is used in Canvas, replacing the background of Canvas webpages with a custom image (via an online image address), and hiding unused side-menu options such as 'History' and 'Help'. All of these settings are saved into the extension so that it automatically applies to the next page you enter. The extension changes what the user sees on the front-end. While it was originally aimed to be an all-in-one extension, it was later changed to be compatible with other such extensions that do not offer the same features as this one does.

# How to install

-First, download the latest source code under one directory.
-In the chrome browser, find your "Manage Extensions menu" while clicking the puzzle piece in the top right hand corner of your Chrome web browser, or Google search this address: 
```
chrome://extensions
```
-Next, **enable developer mode** by clicking the toggle switch next to 'Developer Mode' at the top right corner of the browser page. <br>
-Finally, click the **'Load unpacked'** button near the top left corner of the browser page and select the extension's directory/folder.

# How to run

- The application only runs when you have Canvas open. Simply open a Canvas webpage and the extension automatically operates on its own, depending on what settings the user had saved/changed.
- The application replaces the HTML with a more improved one, and only runs for that website.

# How to build 

- Must have Chrome.
- Must have Developer mode on in Extensions options. (Discussed in 'How to install')
